[] We ran your sequences through our Contamination Screen. The screen found 
contigs that need to be trimmed and/or excluded. Please adjust the 
sequences appropriately and then resubmit your sequences. After you remove the 
contamination, trim any Ns at the ends of the sequence and remove any sequences
that are shorter than 200 nt and not part of a multi-component scaffold.

Note that hits in eukaryotic genomes to mitochondrial sequences can be ignored 
when specific criteria are met. Those criteria are explained below.

Note that mismatches between the name of the adaptor/primer identified in the screen 
and the sequencing technology used to generate the sequencing data should not be used 
to discount the validity of the screen results as the adaptors/primers of many 
different sequencing platforms share sequence similarity.



Screened 4,495 sequences, 31,140,774 bp.
Note: 121 sequences with runs of Ns 10 bp or longer were split before screening.
5 sequences with locations to mask/trim
(5 split spans with locations to mask/trim)
